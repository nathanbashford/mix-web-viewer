# mix-web-viewer

A web-based visualizer for MIX programs, inspired by Donald Knuth's *The Art of 
Computer Programming* and the GNU MDK project.

## Overview

This project aims to bring the power of MIX — Knuth's pedagogical 
assembly-language virtual machine — into an interactive, modern browser 
interface. It allows users to step through MIXAL (MIX Assembly Language) programs 
and visualize memory, registers, and device states in real-time.

## Features

- 📜 Upload and run MIXAL source files
- 🔍 Step-by-step execution through the MIX virtual machine
- 🧠 Real-time display of MIX registers and memory cells
- 💾 Optional output to virtual devices (e.g. files or console)
- 🖥️ Built using modern web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

## Goals

- Lower the entry barrier for understanding machine-level programming
- Serve as a companion tool while reading TAOCP Vol. 1
- Provide an educational and visual bridge from assembly concepts to modern 
computing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanbashford/mix-web-viewer.git
